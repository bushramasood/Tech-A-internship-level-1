                <h3>Chicken Biryani</h3>
                <p class="description">To marinate the chicken
                    (Since this is a non-veg recipe, make sure you use separate kitchen utensils,
                     cutting boards and knives). Cut the chicken into large chunks, skin on. Cut the 
                     onion into thin slices and deep fry in oil over low to medium heat until the onion
                      is caramelized and turns crisp golden brown.Mix half of the fried onion,
                    coriander and mint leaves with the rest of the ingredients for the marinade.
                     Store the marinated chicken in the refrigerator overnight.
                    To cook the rice Soak the basmati rice in water for 45 minutes and drain. 
                    Bring the water to a boil and add some salt. Add the basmati rice. 
                    Cook over medium to high heat for three minutes and keep stirring occasionally.
                    Remove the rice when the rice grain can be broken into 2-3 parts and drain
                    Time to assemble Place the marinated chicken in a heavy bottom pot. Spread half of 
                    the rice on it. Spread half of the remaining fried onions, coriander and mint leaves
                    on the rice Layer the remaining rice on the fried onion, coriander, and mint leaves. 
                    Add some ghee at this stage. Close the lid and seal with some dough or use a damp kitchen 
                    towel to seal the lid. Cook over low heat for about 20 minutes
                    Place a saucepan under the pot and cook the rice over very low heat for another 30 minutes. 
                    Remove the lid and the dough
                    Garnish with more coriander, mint leaves, fried onions and cashew nuts and serve
                     with freshly prepared raita!</p>

        <h3>Thai Tamarind Chicken Stir Fry</h3>
        <p class="description">Marinade
            Add soy sauce or water to corn-starch and mix well. Place sliced chicken pieces 
            in a bowl and add the corn-starch. Mix well and keep the chicken aside for 10-15
             minutes to marinate.           
            Tamarind Sauce
            To a bowl, add tamarind paste, chicken stock, fish sauce, sugar, red chili flakes and 
            chopped chilies. Stir everything together. The consistency of the sauce should be such
            that tamarind paste and sugar should dissolve in the stock and fish sauce. 
            Thai Chicken Stir Fry. Heat a frying pan and add oil to it. Now add chopped garlic & ginger
             paste; once they turn golden brown add the marinade chicken to the oil and stir it 
             vigorously. Wait for the chicken to cook through or till it has acquired a brown tinge. 
             Keep stirring the chicken at regular intervals to avoid it from sticking to the bottom of the pan
              or burning. Once the chicken is done, add the tamarind sauce mix.Stir everything together 
              to make sure the chicken gets coated with the sauce properly. Now add mushrooms and diced 
              onion pieces. Let the mix cook on the flame for 2 minutes before taking it off the heat.
            Garnish
            Transfer the chicken to a serving bowl. Garnish with spring onion & salty peanuts for that
             extra crunch. Serve hot!
            ## How to adjust the taste
            Taste plays an important role. So it’s always better to check for the optimum sweetness
             or sourness before serving the dish.
            Add a little more fresh chili if you like your chicken hot
            Go for 1 tbsp Fish sauce and sugar combination if the tamarind flavor is in excess.
            Squeeze a fresh lime or lemon juice to cut down the salty taste

    <h3>Butter Chicken</h3>
    <p class="description">
        De-bone the tandoori chicken and shred it into small pieces.        
        In a kadhai (large high-sided skillet), heat the oil over medium-high heat until just barely
         beginning to smoke. Add the minced ginger, garlic paste, and sauté - about 30 seconds.       
        Now add tomato puree and cook; about 7-8 minutes, reducing heat to medium.
        Once the sauce starts thickening, add all of the dry spices (Indian spice mixes) and a little 
        salt (be careful not to over-season with the salt as tandoori chicken is already salted, and 
        some Masala spice mixes may already contain salt). Cook, stirring until aromatic, about 30 
        seconds. Add milk, sugar, ½ cup water, and cook again for few more minutes.
        Now add shredded chicken to this curry sauce and cook - about 3 to 4 minutes.      
        Reduce heat; add the cream (reserve about one tablespoon for garnishing) and mix gently.       
        Remove from heat, garnish with the reserved cream, and serve hot with tandoori roti or naan 
        (flatbread, substitute pita if you can't find naan).</p>

        <h3>Spinach & Strawberry Smoothie</h3>
        <p class="description">De-stem and chop up the strawberries, then place in a blender with the rest of the ingredients.
            Blend until smooth, creamy and delicious.       
            Note:
            Citrus fruits like oranges are one of the best sources of vitamin C,
             which is vital to your fertility-enhancing diet. They also contain potassium, 
             calcium, folate and B vitamins, which are all important nutrients in the conception process
              and can help you get pregnant by regulating ovulation.         
            Strawberries are also loaded with vitamin C and folate and are good at protecting eggs
             from damage and aging due to their high levels of antioxidants. They have also been linked
              to naturally increasing a woman’s libido.
            Spinach is high in folate, which has been shown to improve ovulation.
